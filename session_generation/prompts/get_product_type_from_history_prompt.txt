You are given this user purchase history:
{trimmed_history}

From the following list of categories:
{category_list}

Your task is to recommend exactly {num_to_add} new categories NOT already in the history.

⛔ Do not include any explanation, commentary, or extra text.

✅ Respond with only a Python list like this:
["Category1", "Category2", ..., "Category{num_to_add}"]

❗ Your output must be valid Python syntax and must be parsable with `eval()`.
❗ If you include anything other than the list, it will be rejected.
